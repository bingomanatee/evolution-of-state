# Client Side Applications 

## "One page to rule them all"

The power of strong server side applications and Rails 
became the envy of front-end coders. They created their own answer 
to the web application paradigm, Single Page Applications (SPA), 
named after a mythical land in which women were
rumored to roam free wearing nothing but towels, exploring each other with
gentle touch and exfoliants.

## Backbone.js Establishes a New Way of Life

[Backbone.js](https://backbonejs.org/) was the first comprehensive system introduced in 2010
that combined a set of popular practices such as REST and MVC and created 
a unified platform for managing the single page application.
It was wholly driven by JavaScript and developed
its content by transforming data into panels iteratively. This allowed practices
formerly managed by Ruby to be executed on the browser in a series of dynamic
views created by merging data from servers with templates created in JavaScript. 

It is still one of the simplest and most readable self-contained frameworks available.
like the shark, it exists today in much the same way as it did when it originally evolved.

## Angular JS rekindles the Joy of Bloated Complex Frameworks

Angular was polarizing. On the one hand it added much needed structure to the single page app. 
On the other, it added several tiers of concepts at once to the required skillset of a 
front page developer including Dependency Injection, multiple base classes for views, 
and a unique templating system with its own meta-language for looping and piping preprocessors.

[Angular](https://devdocs.io/angularjs~1.6/) was immediately celebrated as obtuse and 
adopted by the programmers eager to prove that they too were big boys and could master
a big boy framework. As more and more sites shifted to Angular, problems arose, so a 
[series of updates](https://versionhistory.net/angular/) (17 major releases, 1.5 trillion minor)
addressed these problems one by one.

The fallout of Angular was a drive towards "enterprise level" coding in the JavaScript 
community, a concept not completely embraced to this day. 

## Bootstrap becomes the first accepted UI system

The introduction of Bootstrap pioneered UX libraries that could be shared across multiple 
stacks and customized to meet the needs of individual sites. It also introduced the responsive grid,
well before Flexbox made it convenient. Crated by Twitter in 2010 it established the first
comprehensive case of a community built set of components for the design platform. 

These platforms also introduced the concept of *responsive design* in which a site was optimized
not just for the wide screen desktop but the comparatively narrow size of a mobile device. As
handheld phones gained the ability to browse the web, the capacity for a site to appear in a readable
form on the phone became increasingly important. 

They were also instrumental in creating form interfaces that had greater appeal
than the form elements that had not evolved much since the introduction of HTML.
