# From The Depths: pre-HTML Online Life

## Bulletin Board Systems (BBS)

HTML was not the first time the internet was used as a communications medium.
Bulletin Board systems (BBS) existed before the internet, and had a small
collection of advocates. They were used to form chat rooms, message boards
and even play games. A broad set of independent enthusiasts and entrepreneurs
used this technology well before web pages were a thing. 

## Compuserve

Compuserve was a large network that started in 1969 as a B to B data sharing service.
As BBS's emerged, it became a powerful player in the BBS market, and hosted several
online games and multiplayer networks. It was the creator of the GIF 
(full name: Compuserve GIF) an image standard with embedded
animation capacities and a compression algorithm that made it valuable in the early 
days when transmission speeds were low. It was acquired by AOL in 1997. 

## America Online

America Online (by that name) appeared in 1989; it popularized online communication to
hundreds of thousands in America and worldwide in part because it relentlessly bombarded
the entire country with installation CDs. It even made its own browser, further confounding
the Browser Wars, before adopting Microsoft's Internet Explorer. It was acquired by 
Time, becoming AOL Time Warner, then Verizon. It was the first email provider for
many people. 

## SFNet

SF NET Coffee House Network was an electronic bulletin board system created by Wayne Gregori in San Francisco, California 
in July 1991. He installed a series of monochronme terminals across the city in 
coffee shops allowing people to chat, meet and share gossip.
