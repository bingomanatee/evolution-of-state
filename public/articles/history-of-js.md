# JavaScript

Officially known as ECMAScript—JavaScript could not be used as it is a trademark of Oracle Corporation—the standard
(ECMA-262) was adopted in 1997. ECMAScript 3, the basis for modern day JavaScript was released in 1999.
Work on ECMAScript 4 began almost immediately after the release of version 3,
ushering in a divisive and combative period for JavaScript.

Many new features were proposed, though by 2003, interest had begun to dwindle and work had stopped on version 4.
While Macromedia (since acquired by Adobe) and Microsoft had used this newer version of the standard in their
implementations—ActionScript (the basis for Flash) and JScript respectively—it wasn’t until 2005,
with the introduction of AJAX (see below), that interest was revived and work on ECMAScript 4 resumed
in the form of a committee comprising Adobe, Microsoft, Mozilla, and, albeit unofficially, Opera.
After many features had been decided, Yahoo joined the committee, sending JavaScript developer Doug Crockford
as their representative. Crockford voiced many concerns with the new standards which garnered the support of Microsoft.
This lead to Microsoft refusing to accept any part of the ECMAScript 4 standard, even threatening legal action,
and prevented it from moving forward. Eventually Crockford proposed the idea of a simpler standard
in the form of ECMAScript 3.1. The JavaScript community followed suit, focusing on the 3.1 standard
and scrapping eight years of work on ECMAScript 4.

Approved in 2009, ECMAScript 3.1 was renamed ECMAScript 5 —
in order to avoid confusion as version 4 had already been implemented in various forms
— and became the most supported version of JavaScript seeing implementation in Firefox 4 in 2011,
and Chrome 16, Internet Explorer 10, Opera 12.10, and Safari 6 in 2012.
