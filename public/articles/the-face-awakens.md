## React and the New Normal

Disenchanted by the heft of Angular and the sting of using a framework sponsored
by a mammoth corporate entity, developers searched for alternatives and landed
on a relatively small library sponsored by a small plucky startup, Facebook. 

Redux was inarguably simpler and more nimble than Angular. Freed of the burden of 
an injection system and closer to the core foundations of web applications -- HTML,
CSS, images and DOM -- and absent of obtuse meta-languages, React emerged with a vengeance,
enrapturing startups with its ability to rapidly develop sites even with semiskilled labor.

React returned the simplicity of HTML-driven content and single-parent components. 
While originally class-based, it soon emerged with an even simpler functional base
and a whole new theology: [Functional Programming](https://github.com/readme/guides/functional-programming-basics). 
the concept of pure functions is that everything is good as long as it comes out of a function.
