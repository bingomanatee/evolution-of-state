# Ducks in a Row: Redux Competition

Here is a brief list of state systems currently in use for React applications:

1. __Redux__:  A predictable state container for JavaScript apps, Redux centralizes application state and logic, enabling powerful capabilities like undo/redo, state persistence, and more. It's known for its strict unidirectional data flow.
2. __RxJS__:  A library for reactive programming using Observables, making it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code. RxJS can be used with React to handle asynchronous data streams in a functional-reactive style.
3. __MobX__:  A simple, scalable state management solution. MobX uses transparent functional reactive programming (TFRP), where the state is mutable but actions are used to modify it, simplifying state management in React applications.
4. __Context API__:  Built into React, the Context API allows you to share values like themes and user information between components without having to explicitly pass props through every level of the tree.
5. __Apollo Client__:  Primarily used for GraphQL data management, Apollo Client provides powerful features to manage local and remote data with GraphQL in React applications.
6. __Recoil__:  A state management library for React that provides several capabilities to manage global state, including a more granular approach to updating and consuming data using atoms and selectors.
7. __Zustand__:  A small, fast, and scalable barebones state-management solution using simplified flux principles. It’s more straightforward and less boilerplate than Redux.
8. __Hookstate__:  A modern, fast, and flexible state management solution built for React. It leverages React hooks for state management with a minimalistic API.
9. __Jotai__:  A primitive and flexible state management solution for React, Jotai takes a minimalistic approach for managing atom-based state.
10. __XState__:  An advanced state management library that allows you to manage both local and global state with finite state machines and statecharts, integrating well with React.
11. __React Query__:  Provides powerful tools to fetch, cache, and update data in React applications. It's excellent for handling server state and asynchronous operations.
12. __SWR__:  Stands for "stale while revalidate," a React hooks library for data fetching. SWR has built-in caching, revalidation, and focus tracking, which makes it ideal for handling server state.
13. __Easy Peasy__:  A Redux-based state management library that abstracts away Redux's complexity. It offers a simple and intuitive API and integrates well with the Redux DevTools.
14. __Valtio__:  Makes proxy-state simple for React and Vanilla. It creates a proxy state and auto-renders when the state is mutated, offering an easy-to-use API with minimal setup.
15. __Rematch__:  Built on top of Redux, Rematch simplifies Redux code by removing boilerplate and adding useful plugins. It's an excellent choice for those who like Redux but want to write less code.
16. __React Redux Firebase__:  Integrates Firebase with React Redux, providing higher-order components for authentication and Firestore integration, ideal for apps that use Firebase as a backend.
17. __Overmind__:  An app state management library with a simple concept of state, actions, and effects, offering a straightforward approach to manage complex application states.
18. __Unstated__:  Designed to create a minimalistic state management solution using React's built-in Context API and hooks, Unstated is straightforward and doesn't introduce new abstractions.
19. __Akita__:  A state management pattern built on top of RxJS. It's geared towards Angular but can be used with React, focusing on simplicity and scalability in managing a data store.
20. __Immutable.js__:  Offers Immutable collections for JavaScript, ensuring that the state in your React app does not get mutated unexpectedly, which can lead to more predictable code.
21. __WatermelonDB__:  Built to scale, WatermelonDB is an optimized database for React and React Native applications. It's excellent for applications with complex data structures and large datasets.
22. __Refract__:  Leverages reactive programming (using RxJS, most often) to handle side-effects in your React apps, separating side-effect management from UI logic.
23. __Redux-Saga__:  A middleware for Redux that allows handling side effects in your application. It uses generator functions to make asynchronous flows easy and readable.
24. __Redux-Observable__:  Middleware for Redux to handle asynchronous actions as observables using RxJS. It's a good choice if you are already familiar with RxJS.
25. __ReSub__:  Developed by Microsoft, ReSub is a library for writing better React components and data stores. It automatically manages subscriptions and updates to reduce boilerplate.
26. __Effector__:  An effective multi-store state manager for JavaScript apps, Effector allows you to manage data in complex applications without the overhead of Redux or MobX.
27. __Microstates.js__:  Designed to create highly composable and predictable state containers, Microstates.js provides a gentle introduction to immutable, functional state management.
28. __Kea__:  A state management library for React that leverages Redux under the hood. Kea’s logic is defined in a single place, making it cleaner and easier to understand than traditional Redux.
29. __Alt.js__:  Built around Flux architecture, Alt.js is a library for managing the state of your React applications. It provides utilities for a more straightforward and less boilerplate-heavy approach than traditional Flux.
30. __MobX State Tree (MST)__:  Combines the simplicity and ease of mutable data with the traceability of immutable data and reactive programming. MST is particularly well-suited for complex domain models.
31. __Cerebral__:  A declarative state and side effects management solution for JavaScript apps. It uses function-tree for orchestrating complex sequences of actions.
32. __Fluxible__:  Developed by Yahoo, Fluxible is a pluggable container for isomorphic flux applications, providing a consistent structure that scales well for large applications.
33. __Fluxxor__:  Fluxxor is a set of tools to facilitate building JavaScript data layers using Facebook's Flux architecture principles.
34. __Freactal__:  A composable state management library for React applications, Freactal offers a clean, modern approach to managing state with higher-order components.
35. __Meiosis__:  A pattern for managing state in JavaScript applications that can be used with any virtual DOM library, including React. It offers a simple and functional approach to state management.
36. __Relay__:  Developed by Facebook, Relay is a framework for building data-driven React applications. It uses GraphQL, providing tight integration with React components for fetching data.
37. __NuclearJS__:  Heavily inspired by Flux and ImmutableJS, NuclearJS offers traditional Flux architecture with immutable data structures, optimizing performance and predictability.
38. __Remx__:  A lightweight state management solution based on MobX. It provides a simpler API and encourages a more straightforward way to make your data reactive.
39. __Reselect__:  A selector library for Redux, Reselect can compute derived data, allowing Redux to store the minimal possible state and improving performance on complex calculations.
40. __ReactN__:  A minimalistic extension of React to add global state management. It modifies React's setState function to update a global state object.
41. __DvaJS__:  Built on top of Redux, Redux-saga
