# Unit Testing 

Unit Testing was Pioneered with JUnit in 1997 but was carried into the popular lexicon in 
1997 by the introduction of Ruby. the Javascript and PHP community were resistant
to it. One of the presenters at ZendCon (the "Rails of PHP") 90 mocked the audience by mentioning
offhand, "you all test your code don't you?" to deafening silence, which he filled with 
a follow-up, "You're all bad coders."

JavaScript developers did not embrace unit testing for another 12 years after that in part
because the CI/CD pipelines did not exist to reinforce tests, and in part because they 
simply did not want to. Angular was the first framework to embrace unit testing and began the
slow adoption curve for testing in the front end community. The emergence of NPM as a shared library
also sped it along, as a larger audience became dependent on the quality of a smaller subset of 
JavaScript code. 

Ironically the impetus for many of Angular's creation - the desire to encase all of Javascript's
fundamental systems in a DI layer well before modules were an essential part of the
JavaScript toolkit - was not clearly articulated.
