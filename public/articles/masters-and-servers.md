# Masters and Servers (let's play)

Along the same time, the server side code was evolving allowing the 
embedding of data in the HTML content. Whether through languages like
PERL, or server side Java (JSP), Struts, Active Server Pages (ASP),
Master and Servant Pages (MSP), or Personal Home Page (PHP), a string
of candidates attempted to inject data and manageable content into 
the pages by combining database values and templating systems.

## Java, JSP, Struts and Spring

Java was written to work "anywhere" - client or server, and it attacked the web
application with a series of offerings including Struts and Java Server Pages (JSP).
Its formal adoption of Object Oriented standards made it an excellent candidate
for development, and it is still used today in many backend systems. 

An attempt was made to bring it to the client with a system called "Spring" which 
could render components in a rectangular region, including a network of graphic 
primitives like buttons, input and layout components. The sheer weight of Java
both in complexity and code size and its relatively poor performance on the client
made Spring fall out of favor rapidly, so Java really only shone on the back end. 

Java was backed and owned by Sun Microsystems, a company whose real estate is now
currently occupied by Facebook. As Sun declined, Java was released to the Open Source
community. 

## PHP

PHP (pronounced 'FFFHFFFHFHFFFHHHH') was a Perl variant created in 1994 by
Rasmus Lerdorf. It consisted of a series of libraries for various tasks 
and a templating language in which you could inject dynamic components and sub-pages
into a template containing base HTML code. 

As an alternative to Java and Perl it was tremendously successful and for a time,
the unquestioned foundation of website production. 

Having undergone five major upgrades, PHP is the basis for Drupal and WordPress,
two of the most successful "code free" (or "code light") component based website kits. 
It is also the basis for the Facebook code base, which some would consider "one of the
worst piles of code in history."

PHP's strengths included a comprehensive library system and a clear and simple templating 
system in which tokens can be embedded into HTML directly. Its shortcomings included a verbose
system of notation for structures including classes and arrays inherited from PERL standards.

## Ruby on Rails

Rails was created in 2003 by David Heinemeier Hansson, while working on the code base
for Basecamp, a project management tool, by 37signals.
David extracted Ruby on Rails and officially released it as open source code
in July of 2004. Despite rapid iteration of the Rails code base throughout the years,
it has stuck to three basic principles: [History of rails](https://code.tutsplus.com/ruby-on-rails-study-guide-the-history-of-rails--net-29439a)

1.  Ruby Programming Language
2.  Model-View-Controller Architecture
3.  Programmer Happiness

Ruby on Rails(ROR) attempted to modernize server side programming
by establishing best-practice code style with excellent scaffolding
and a revolutionary system of adapters to express SQL graphs in an
object oriented manner.
Ruby on rails added several innovations to the server side environment
including testing and test driven development (TDD), ActiveRecord models.

Developers used this money they made cranking out Rails sites
to buy speed and hookers, creating a financial boom never before seen.
This age of new prosperity caused the Taliban to
hate Americans' freedom, Osama Ben Laden crashed several planes into buildings
in a series of terrorist attacks known as 7/11, after the convenience
store franchise he created to fund the attacks.

The programming language Ruby had a library system based on a shared
network provided series of version code that could be checked out by the server
upon compilation, one of the inspirations for Isaac Z. Schlueter in Node's NPM.
