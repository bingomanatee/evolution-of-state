# VRML: Metaverse Without the Zuck

...In this atmosphere of VR buzz---in late 1993---software engineers Mark Pesce 
and Anthony Parisi created the rudiments of a 3D web browser called Labyrinth. 
In May of 1994, Pesce, Parisi, and Peter Kennard gave a presentation about Labyrinth 
at the First World Wide Web Conference in Geneva. Not long after, another engineer
named Dave Raggett presented a paper that proposed "Extending WWW to support
Platform Independent Virtual Reality."

...After picking up support from other developers, the VRML standard debuted in November 1994. 
At first, VRML only supported 3D static objects, but over time the standard grew to 
encompass avatars, animations, pulling in multimedia, and more. Early on, VRML drew support 
from major corporations such as Microsoft, Netscape, Silicon Graphics, and dozens of others. 
For a short time, its future seemed pretty solid.

Several university departments, especially those that studied new media,
experimented with VRML and posted their creations online. 3D hardware vendor
Silicon Graphics embraced VRML and released 3D animations featuring a character named "Floops." 
Wired Magazine initially hosted the VRML Architecture Group and the VRML mailing list. 

...In 1996, CNET wrote about VRML's failure to meet expectations, saying, 
"Bandwidth constraints, hardware limitations, and, worst of all, lack of compelling 
applications may make the 3D technology more virtual than real for the time being."
