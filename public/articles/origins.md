# The Dawn of the Information Age

Web pages evolved long before state; in fact, before JavaScript, CSS, dynamic pages,
social media and portable phones. They were designed by scientists with the help 
of Albert Gore to circulate academic information between the educated elite to 
accelerate the growth of humanity. He invented it in 1990 while working in CERN. 

They came up with something similar to an online version of Microsoft Word. 

It was good enough for a first go, but difficult to monetize. 

## The First Browsers

Mosaic was technically the first web browser in 1993. Mosaic was developed 
at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)
at the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign beginning in late 1992.
NCSA released it in 1993, and officially discontinued development 
and support on January 7, 1997. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser))

Netscape Navigator followed in 1994 by y Marc Andreessen, 
a part-time employee of the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications at the University of Illinois. After Andreessen graduated in 1993, 
he moved to California and there met Jim Clark, the recently departed founder of
Silicon Graphics. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator)

Internet Explorer was unleashed in 1995, triggering a period from 1995-2001 called the 
"Browser Wars" as Navigator and Explorer released a series of browsers with divergent 
standards forcing developers to fork any use of new features and/or "shim" in 
hand coded replacements to a feature present in one browser but absent in another,
or abdicate new features in favor of a smaller toolset that had broader adaption.  

Sites of this period were largely passive showcases of products and information,
derided as "brochure ware" as more interactive technology emerged.
