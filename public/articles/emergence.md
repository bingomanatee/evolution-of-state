# Emergence

Craig Newmark used this technology to become immensely upper middle class,
and proving that hot chicks would in fact have sex with geeky men, 
under specific circumstances.

A new generation of youth adopted the technology to pursue their interests,
from drugs and sex to money and violence. Styling themselves off their idol,
Gary Gygax, these children called themselves "Web Masters" and named their 
color scheme "Hex colors" off the hexagonal maps used by Gygax 
in his role playing games. But it became clear that no matter 
how fancy the HTML that Al Gore and Barack Obama
invented was inadequate for acquiring the desired volume of sex,
drugs, violence and money. 

As the threat of Y2K loomed a set of computer scientists strove to add
dynamism to the Internet, and a new programming language was introduced,
called Java. Java was very formal, dense and hard to understand
in part because it had features like strict typing and object oriented code, 
so a "kid friendly" version of it was developed for Web Masters, called "JavaScript."
This began a ten year period in which developers had to explain that JavaScript was not
a dialect of Java, mostly to people who didn't know what Java was in the first place.
